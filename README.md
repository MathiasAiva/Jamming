# Jamming
Spotify Playlist Creator MicroProject

Jammming is a web app that allows you to create playlists in a simple way. It's obviously easier to create a playlist directly with Spotify, but this project was maded to practice not to do something meaningful.

It connects to the spotify API using the **implicit grant OAuth Flow**, which you can check [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/). 

The **API requests** are in a file called Spotify.js (jamming/src/util/Spotify.js), and the **Parent** is called App.js (Jamming/src/Components/App/App.js).

**DISCLAIMER: The idea of this project wasn't made by me, I just followed the instructions that Codecademy gave me. Thats why I call it a microProject, I just coded what they told me. I do have projects completely made by me.**
